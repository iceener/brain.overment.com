# All I want to Know is Where Im Going to Die So Ill Never Go There

One of the more interesting form of books I've read. The whole thing takes the form of a dialogue between Warren Buffet, Charlie Munger, a librarian, and a Seeker.

The latter, upon entering the library, meets the others, who help him find what he is looking for: **Wisdom, defined as the ability to make good decisions.**

This is a book full of practical use of [Mental Models](../Mental%20Models/Mental%20Models.md) and the principles that guide its characters. I would only add that this title is far less challenging than the author's earlier book, [Seeking Wisdom](Seeking%20Wisdom.md), which I also highly recommend.

# Almanack of Naval Ravikant


Almanack of Naval Ravikant is one of the books where there is no point for making highlights, because you would end up with highlighting everything. It is a collection and interpretation of statements made by Naval Ravkinant â€” a well known Sillicon Valley investor, who made early investments in companies such Notion, Twitter and Uber. This book have thought me a lot about [Leverage](../Mental%20Models/Leverage.md) based on the creation of products with marginal cost of replication.

## Wealth vs Money / Status Game

- Wealth is a resource that works for you, even when you sleep
- Money is a way of transforming time and wealth
- Status is your position in the social hierarchy

It is good to live playing the Wealth Game instead of seeking Status. It is useful to understand how to create a true value and ignore people who play Status Game, because they become better by attacking other people (in order to win Status Game, others has to lose).

## Specific Knowledge 

This is a type of knowledge that cannot be transferred and its [Automation](../Tools/Automation.md) is not possible. If someone can teach you something, it means they can also teach somone else. Such knowledge, in my opinion, comes from a combination of natural predispositions [Understanding](../Core/Understanding.md), hard work ([Process](../Core/Process.md)) and combining that with the unique qualities of our character.

## Lessons
- Learn to build and sell: **you will become unstoppable.**
- You will never be worth more than you think. In a business context, set yourself your hourly rate and work as if you actually earn that much
- Independence is more important than how much you earn. It is what gives you space and control.
- When was the last time you were bored? Boredom gives space and space is an element of creativity.
- If you can't decide, the answer is NO
- If you are making a decision, choose the option that is more difficult in the short term.
- Happiness is a matter of our decision

...and many, many others.

If we think of the opposite of fragility, strength or hardness comes to mind. However even if we imagine a super-hard material, there is a good chance that we can find a harder one, use a wek point or [Leverage](../Mental%20Models/Leverage.md) to destroy or permanently damage it.

Now imagine a material that every time you try to damage or destroy it, it makes it stronger than before. Such a feature is Antifragility. 

Antifragility is a powerful concept in the context of building systems, such a company or our life system. Because of that I use it for creating my own [Process](../Core/Process.md) and this require a constant Questioning, Making Mistakes and learning from them.

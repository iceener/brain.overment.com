# My Learning System

I consider the ability to **learn quickly** as one of the most important of all, especailly in the face of a very fast-changing world. I also believe that it's a skill that can simply be developed with some discipline and a good habits.

For example I can see that my memory has become **incomparably better over the past few years**. I could be wrong but I assume it's connected with:

- reading [Books](../Books/Books.md)
- listening to i.e. [Huberman Lab](../Learning/Huberman%20Lab.md)
- taking care of [Process](Process.md)
- much less stress because of my new environment and wisdom from [Books](../Books/Books.md)

## How do I learn? 

Learning to me is a process which starts with **surrounding myself with a given topic** based on **the best available sources**, which I choose very carefully — I believe this choice define how effectively I learn.

Knowledge sources are useually centered around people or projects. There are also people around those people, who are very interesting. We can say tat it is **a network of connections** that allows us to reach out to more sources and thus shape our entire environment.

[Books](../Books/Books.md) are another part of the knowledge acquisition process. The key is just to choose the right titles ([Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) may help here).

At the end you can say thtat my learning process is all about:
- Reading books, because it is like, in a way, a conversation with an author
- Having fun. Lots of it!
- Openess and Detachment
	- Openess — an assumption that the information **may be** true and valuable
	- Distance — an assumption that not everything **is truth**, but most likely — an opinion or a perspective
	- If you combine both Openess and Detachment, you are able to develop your unique approach to a given topic and even become better with it, than a person you are learning from.
- I reach out for the best possible sources (blogs, articles, newsletters, paid communities, youtube channels, twitter accounts and online courses)
- I get to know people who are "at the root" of a topic (such as technology developers or prominent experts). I usually do this on Twitter or Instagram.
- I discover titles of recommended books and those that intigue me
- I subscribe to the newsletters of the above-mentioned people

## How much do I learn?

I don't measure it in any way, but learning is my habit and integral part of my day. This means that I use practically **every free moment to learn something**. AT the same time I also have space for total non-thinking, rest and silence, which I also see as a important part of the process of acquring knowledge ([Huberman Lab](../Learning/Huberman%20Lab.md) again, confirm that).

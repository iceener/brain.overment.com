# My Values

My fundamental values guide my decision-making process. My [Process](Process.md) and direction stem directly from them. 

Each of the following values is equally important to me and unchanging throughout my life.

## My life's philosophy

**To Inspire others to grow.**

## My values

- **Curiosity:** That's the source of everything I love.
- **Freedom:** Which comes from discipline.
- **Enthusiasm:** This attitude helps me overcome everything.

You might wonder how I use these values in daily life. Whenever I make an important decision, I refer back to my values, asking, "Is this decision aligned with them and leading me in the direction I've set?" If it is, I won't hesitate.

Values not only help with tough decisions but also make the decision-making process more efficient. I can say that every time I make a decision based on my values, I end up with a good result. However, our perception of reality must still be taken into account, particularly the words of Ray Dalio, who said that **we cannot see reality as it is, due to our ego and blind spots.**

## How did I define my values?

There was a program, [Reign and Own](https://zenjaskiniowca.pl/programy/panuj-i-posiadaj) (PL), by Rafał Mazur, that guided me through defining my life's philosophy and mission. I won't detail the entire process here since it's part of Rafał's program. I recommend purchasing it and following all the steps as he suggests.

## Are my Values changing?

Recently, I added enthusiasm to my list due to a "moment of realization" while reading the book [Almanack of Naval Ravikant](../Books/Almanack%20of%20Naval%20Ravikant.md). One quote from Naval states that feeling happy is a decision we make. I believe enthusiasm is a crucial part of this.

From that point on, I decided to take it seriously, contrary to what "The Big Five" test indicated, suggesting that in terms of enthusiasm, I'm in the 1st percentile (lowest). Simultaneously, books like [The Happines Advantage](../Books/The%20Happines%20Advantage.md) and [Letting Go](../Books/Letting%20Go.md) unequivocally suggest the significant role of enthusiasm in achieving anything.

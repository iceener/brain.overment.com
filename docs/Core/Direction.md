# Direction

Direction has **almost** enirely replaced my Goals. Instead of trying **to predict where I want to go**, I just have a clear direction in which I'm heading. This may be equated with a vision or life philosophy, which I wrote more about when I was writing about my [Values](Values.md)

With a clearly defined direction, I just have to make sure, that I'm continually optimize my [Process](Process.md) and moving with the same pace — this is an example of using [20 Mile March](../Mental%20Models/20%20Mile%20March.md).

## Where I'm heading to?

My purpose is to **continuously grow** and **inspire others to grow**. I'm doing so in the **most effective way possible**, operating at a **maximum available scale** by utilising [Leverage](../Mental%20Models/Leverage.md).

This statement appears in every day, in almost every action I take. To put this clearly — **this is what my life is all about.**

## How do I define my Direction

It was a pretty long process I've described here — [Knowing thyself](Knowing%20thyself.md). In a some way I was feeling this all the time, but it wasn't easy to put this in a simple words.

## Do I use goals?

Of course I do. I believe in a some situations that's a good thing to have something you are aiming for. But at the same time, I have in mind, that goals may give me a disillusion and disappointment. I just try to keep my both eyes on what I'm doing right now, instead of thinking what will happen in the future. 

I've learned a lot about a proper attitude towards goals from books [Chop Wood, Carry Water](../Books/Chop%20Wood,%20Carry%20Water.md), [Way of The Peaceful Warrior](../Books/Way%20of%20The%20Peaceful%20Warrior.md) and [How to Fail at Almost Anything and Still Win Big](../Books/How%20to%20Fail%20at%20Almost%20Anything%20and%20Still%20Win%20Big.md).

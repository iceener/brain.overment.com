## Hardware I use

I use several devices for my daily work, most of which are from Apple, as I find them to be the best among all available alternatives. I've worked on Windows for many years, but ever since I got my first MacBook, I can't imagine going back.

The most important aspects for me are hardware performance, minimalist design, and my workflow. This is achievable thanks to numerous [Apps](Apps.md) exclusive to macOS/iOS.

> I bought a Razer Seiren microphone right at the beginning of the development of my YouTube channel. Taking care of high quality audio is key, although nowadays you can get much cheaper equipment that offers more capabilities.

# Hardware

I use several devices for my daily work, most of which are from Apple, as I find them to be the best among all available alternatives. I've worked on Windows for many years, but ever since I got my first MacBook, I can't imagine going back.

The most important aspects for me are hardware performance, minimalist design, and my workflow. This is achievable thanks to numerous [Apps](Apps.md) exclusive to macOS/iOS.

## Taleb on Ergodicity — Selected Quotes

> “The tragedy of modernity is that it considers non‑ergodic systems as if they were ergodic.” — Nassim Nicholas Taleb

> “In an ergodic world, the ensemble average and time average are the same. In the real world, they almost never are.” — Nassim Nicholas Taleb

> “You don’t have the right to expose others to ruin. Non‑ergodicity means some errors are final.” — Nassim Nicholas Taleb

> “If you ignore ergodicity, you will systematically underestimate risk and overestimate your knowledge.” — Nassim Nicholas Taleb

> “Modern portfolio theory mistakes a cross‑sectional snapshot for a time path. That’s what happens when you confuse an ensemble average with an ergodic process.” — Nassim Nicholas Taleb

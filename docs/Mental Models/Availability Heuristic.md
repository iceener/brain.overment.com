# Availability Heuristic

The Availability Heuristic is a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, or decision.

## Core Concept

This cognitive bias leads us to overestimate the likelihood or importance of things that are more readily available in memory, which is influenced by:
- How recent the memories are
- How unusual or emotionally charged the memories are
- How vivid or concrete the memories are

The more easily we can recall examples of something, the more probable or significant we believe it to be.

## Key Benefits of Awareness

- Improves risk assessment by countering emotional reactions
- Helps avoid overreacting to recent or dramatic events
- Enables more balanced and data-driven decision-making
- Reduces susceptibility to media-induced fears

## Examples

- People often fear flying more than driving, despite driving being statistically more dangerous, because plane crashes receive more media coverage
- Investors may overweight recent market performance in their expectations
- After seeing news about a shark attack, people overestimate the danger of swimming in the ocean
- Doctors might diagnose a disease they've recently studied or encountered, even when it's statistically unlikely

## Application

To counter the availability heuristic:
1. Seek statistical information rather than relying on anecdotes
2. Consider base rates and actual probabilities
3. Be aware of how media exposure affects your perception
4. Create decision-making frameworks that rely on data
5. Ask "What am I not seeing?" when assessing risks

## What is it about?

This is a concept from a book [Great by Choice](../Books/Great%20by%20Choice.md) ~ Jim Collins, which says that for a long distance, a slower but regular pace is better than a sprint. In other words — it's about moving at a steady pace **regardless of an extenral and internal factors**. This includes how you feel, how much work do you have and any unpredictable circumstances. 

## How do I use this 20 Mile March?

A concept of a steady pace helps me develop my [Process](../Core/Process.md) so it can become [Antifragile](../Books/Antifragile.md). For example I could record 3-4 videos a week and publish on [overment](../Projects/overment.md). I record one, but because of that I am able to do it regularly (as long as it is a priority for me).

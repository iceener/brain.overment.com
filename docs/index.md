Hey there, I'm Adam and this is my digital garden where I share **everything I know.** I originally created it for myself, but you might find something valuable here too.

This website will never be finished. Everything here will evolve over time, and some things may never be completed, because **what is true for me today may not be true for me tomorrow**. I think this reflects my approach to our ever-changing world.

## What you can find here?

- My [Process](Core/Process.md) always guides me toward my [Direction](Core/Direction.md), grounded in my [Values](Core/Values.md) and deep self-awareness ([Knowing thyself](Core/Knowing%20thyself.md)).
- My [Learning System](Core/Learning%20System.md).
- [Books](Books/Books.md) I've read.
- [Apps I use and how I use them](Tools/Apps.md).
- [Hardware I use](Tools/Hardware.md).
- Projects I'm working on, such as [eduweb](Projects/eduweb.md), [easy.tools](Projects/easy_.md), [Alice](Projects/Alice.md), and [overment](Projects/overment.md).
- Things I'm learning about: [programming](Programming/index.md), [AI](AI/index.md), [business](Business/index.md), and [mental models](Mental%20Models/index.md).
- All my free and paid publications.

## Where to Find Me

This is a place where I share everything I know. I've create this place primarily for myself. At the same time, I thought you might find it all, equally valuable to you.

Please keep in mind, that this project won't be finished. What's most important, many things will change over time, because **what's true for me today, tomorrow probably won't be** — this is my strategy for a constantly changing world. 

## The most important topics: 

- My [Process](Core/Process.md) which allows me to move in the [Direction](Core/Direction.md) I have set for myself, based on my [Values](Core/Values.md) and [Knowing thyself](Core/Knowing%20thyself.md)
- How I learn based on my [Learning System](Core/Learning%20System.md)
- Everything I know about [Mental Models](Mental%20Models/Mental%20Models.md)
- My thoughts about [Books](Books/Books.md) I read
- A list and my thoughts about [Apps](Tools/Apps.md)
- Thoguhts about my [Hardware](Tools/Hardware.md)
- Perspective and ideas about [Automation](Tools/Automation.md)s
- Notes on Programming, Design, Marketing and Business.
- Notes about my [Process](Core/Process.md)
- My all free and paid publications

## Where you can find me? 

I like to talk to people, so if there is anything I need to know or you'd like to share with me, don't think twice. If I won't reply, please do not consider it personal, but still — I'll do my best.

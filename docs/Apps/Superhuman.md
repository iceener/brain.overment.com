Superhuman is a fantastic email client focused on high efficiency through keyboard shortcuts support and a well-optimized UI. Its significant limitation is that it connects exclusively to Gmail or GSuite and Outlook mailboxes.

**Errors:**
I've encountered synchronization errors a few times and even lost a draft of a written message. Sometimes there are problems with message formatting, and the text customization options are quite limited, which is both an advantage and a disadvantage. The last drawback is that performing actions on multiple threads simultaneously takes much longer than with Gmail.

**Using Superhuman:**
- I have 5 mailboxes, switched with the shortcut ⌃1-5
- `k` and `j` switch to the next and previous messages
- ⇧ and up/down arrows select messages in the inbox
- the `gi` shortcut takes you to the inbox view
- `/` activates the search
- ⇧? opens the list of keyboard shortcuts
- ⌘K opens the command palette (extremely useful)
- I archive all messages or ultimately assign labels to them (action required / awaiting response)
- I mark exceptionally important messages with a star
- I use the schedule send option
- I reply to the rest of the messages immediately
- I use the "remind if no reply" option
- I write the content of long emails in iA Writer and then use a macro to convert markdown syntax to styled text and paste it directly into the message content.
- I use the Keyboard Maestro macro to create new messages based on clipboard content
- I have Superhuman notifications disabled, but some messages are forwarded to a Slack channel, which is allowed to send me notifications unless I am in DND mode.
- I use Split Inbox (search thread, activate palette ⌘K, select split inbox, give it a name. TIP: you can use formulas in search, e.g., `from:` or `and`)
- I additionally filter newsletters using Make.com
- I use superhuman:// for direct thread linking (opens the app)
- I use the Superhuman mobile app. I have no complaints about it
- I work based on inbox 0 and do not reply to all messages if I see no need.

Fun fact: Cron is a calendar created in the spirit of Superhuman.

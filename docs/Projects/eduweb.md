# eduweb & ahoy!

eduweb is an educational platform with video courses for tech outliers. 
Ahoy! is a closed, paid community for them. Both projects are using [easy_](easy_.md) for managing subscriptions and premium content access. We are using a lot of [Automation](../Tools/Automation.md)s which allow us to do it all in a very small team.

I've published many courses and hundreds of articles and posts both on eduweb and ahoy! You can find an examples below. 

**Keyboard Maestro** (PL)

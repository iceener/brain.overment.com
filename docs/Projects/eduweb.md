# eduweb & Ahoy!

eduweb is an educational platform with video courses for tech outliers. Ahoy! is a community for them. Both projects use Easytools for managing subscriptions and premium content access. 

Thanks to [Automation](../Tools/Automation.md), we can do it all with a relatively small team.

I've published many courses and hundreds of articles and posts both on eduweb and ahoy! You can find them here: https://eduweb.pl

title: Alice
---
Alice is a name that has two meaning for me:

- Alice, as a desktop app, available as a standalone product at https://heyalice.app
- Alice, as a personal agent, available just for me.

Alice is a project Iâ€™ve been working on since December 2022, right after the "ChatGPT moment". It quickly became my sandbox for exploring what generative AI can and cannot do. Due to its complexity, it has also been quite a challenge for my programming skills, as everything I design needs to work flawlessly (or at least aim to) while remaining flexible enough to keep up with the rapid pace of changes in the field.

Alice is an advanced chat UI for LLMs with a minimalistic interface. It provides easy access to large language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, xAI, and open-source models using Groq, Ollama, or LMStudio. It also supports integration with MCP (Model Context Protocol), offering Tools, Prompts, Resources, and Sampling.

The Alice app is a highly customizable blank slate that you can shape however you like, either by importing assistants from the library or by creating your own. 

The key concepts of Alice are:

- **Assistants:** Profiles with a name, avatar, and main system prompt that define their behavior.  
- **Skills:** These are described through prompts, can be assigned to an assistant, and invoked during conversations via the `/` button or the available menu.  
- **Tools:** Tools can be added using Model Context Protocol servers, allowing assistants to access and use external apps or services.  
- **Documents:** You can upload text-based documents and assign them to assistants so they can explore them during chats using AI agentic logic.

## Personal AI agent

Alice has her own personality, appearance, voice, memory, and skills. She can access the Internet as well as external apps and services. Technically, she is a back-end application running on my VPS and can be accessed directly through my watch, phone, or car. She can also perform background tasks triggered by schedules or external events.

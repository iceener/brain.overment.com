[automation.house](https://automation.house/) is a company in which we use no-code and low-code [Automation](../Tools/Automation.md) to help companies improve their internal processes. 

This company have officially started in Q1 2021. But a story begins in 2019 when me and Greg Rog, have found that Automation may help not just us. We started a cooperation with a couple of clients and came up with an idea that we can't do it by ourselves. A couple of months later we have created a cohort-based course "Everyday Automated" and then our students became first employees of Automation House.

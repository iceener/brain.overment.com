# Design Maestro

> This project is no longer under development. It has been replaced by the [Alice](Alice.md) app.

This is a package of Keyboard Maestro macro, created for designers who wants to optimise their workflow in macOS / Figma or Webflow.

## Podium on Product Hunt! ðŸŽ‰

In June 2022 Design Maestro took a 3rd place on Product Hunt

## Design Maestro FREE

The project was published at the end of March 2022 as a free version of 10 macros:
https://designmaestro.io

In May 2022, I discovered an action in Keyboard Maestro called Custom HTML Prompt, which is intended to allow you to display a dialog box based on your own HTML code. I decided to take advantage of this to create a fully customized interface for Design Maestro, which looks as follows:

The entire interface was created with HTML/CSS and JavaScript with Svelte framework bundled with [Vitejs.dev](https://vitejs.dev/). What's more the whole interface is based on JSON objects which means that you can create your own list, prompts and forms.

## Predefined Macros

We have created a set of predefined, plug&play macros you can use right away. DesignMaestro macros were created with designers in mind to improving their work by saving time on repeatitive tasks. 

**This includes:** 
- optimizing image file sizes (with tinyPNG API)
- removing backround from selected images (with remove.bg API)
- assets picker
- color picker (from library)
- global system picker (copying hex color from pixel which is pointed with a mouse)
- screen OCR
- quick translation & searching
- quick creating a figma, notion and webflow projects
- pasting `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit interdum hendrerit ex vitae sodales.`

Those macros are available here for free: https://designmaestro.io.


## Create a custom Prompt

DesignMaestro allows you to create a simple form which contains: 
- a title & description
- form inputs (text, textarea, select, color, radio, datetime-local)
- actions buttons (confirm and cancel)

An example looks like this:

![](https://space.overment.com/Shared-Image-2022-05-17-14-17-46-tQzvt/Shared-Image-2022-05-17-14-17-46.png)

In order to generate this prompt like this, basically you have to:
1. Create a JSON object and save it's stringify version in a `DMLauncher` variable of Keyboard Maestro. 
2. Use `Execute a Macro` action and trigger `(util) Render` macro.

All input values will be saved in Keyboard Maestro variables and names of those variables will match inputs `name` field. For example: `<input name="example" />` value will be saved in a variable with a name `example`. 

| Please note that those variables will be saved only if Prompt will be ended with a confirmation (pressing `Enter` or `Primary button`)

**JSON reference both for prompt and lists configuration looks like this:**

```
{

Â  "type": "prompt", // prompt or list
Â  
Â  "actionType": "default", // required only for type: "list". default - trigger macro by name | download - downloads a image file and set its content to clipboard | copy - copy a value of list item to a clipboard

Â  "header": {

Â  Â  "active": true,

Â  Â  "title": "", // prompt header

Â  Â  "description": ""  // prompt description

Â  },

Â  "actions": { // custom prompt actions

Â  Â  "mode": "decision", // decision | confirm. Decision displays boths confirmation & cancel buttons and confirm displays just a confirm button

Â  Â  "visible": true, // true | false - with type of list, actions should be set to false
bra
Â  Â  "confirmLabel": "Translate", // confirm button label

Â  Â  "cancelLabel": "Nevermind" // cancel button label

Â  },

Â  "inputs": [] // see a reference below. This is required for `type: prompt`

  "list": [] // see a reference below. This is required for `type: list`

}
```

**JSON reference for inputs looks like this:**

As you can see it's an array of objects describing each input field.

```json
[

	{ // TEXT / TEXTAREA / DATE INPUT FIELD

Â  Â  Â  "type": "text", // text | textarea | datetime-local 

Â  Â  Â  "name": "textVar", // value of this input is connected with KM variable with this name

Â  Â  Â  "label": "This is a text field", // input label
Â  Â  Â  
Â  Â  Â  "value": "default value", // it can be set right here or by setting a KM Variable with a name coresponding to this input name. 
Â  Â  Â  
Â  Â  Â  "placeholder": "Type something", // input placeholder

Â  Â  Â  "focused": true, // autofocus. Make sure to have a single one for each prompt

	  "rows": 8 // for textarea only! Default: 8

Â  Â  },

Â  Â  { // COLOR picker input

Â  Â  Â  "type": "color",

Â  Â  Â  "name": "colorVar", // value of this input is connected with KM variable with this name.
Â  Â  Â  
Â  Â  Â  "value": "#ffffff", // it can be set right here or by setting a KM Variable with a name coresponding to this input name. 

Â  Â  Â  "label": "Quick Snippet", // input label

Â  Â  },
Â  Â  
    { // SELECT input

Â  Â  Â  "type": "select",

Â  Â  Â  "name": "selectVar", // value of this input is connected with KM variable with this name.

Â  Â  Â  "label": "Select something",  // input label

Â  Â  Â  "placeholder": "Choose", // input placeholder

Â  Â  Â  "value": "en/pl", // default value

Â  Â  Â  "focused": true, // autofocus. Make sure to have a single one for each prompt

      "options": [ // An array of options 
        { 
          "label":"Label", // Option label 
          "value": "option1",  // Option value
          "selected": true // true / false is selected
        }
	  ]
	}
]
```

**JSON reference for list items looks like this:**

As you can see it's an array of objects describing each list item.

```
[
  {
	  "label": "", // list item main label
	  "value": "", // value of an item. May be: a macro name to trigger, value to be copied to clipboard or an image file needed to be downloaded and copied to clipboard
	  "description":"" // description of an item, is showing on a right side
	  "thumbnail": "" // (optional) url to a thumbnail (must be public and point to the image file)
  }
]
```

## Confirm & Cancel actions

While prompt is displayed there're two ways to close it: by `confirming`, which means saving a variables to Keyboard Maestro or by `cancelling` and just closing a window. 

In order to make sure that following actions won't be activated, just use `if statement` and check if a variable called `DMContinue` is set to `true`, like so:

## Summary

In order to generate a new prompt you need to: 
- create a configuration JSON
- add `inputs` (for type: prompt) and `list` (for type: list)
- trigger a macro called `(util) Render` with `Execute a Macro` action.

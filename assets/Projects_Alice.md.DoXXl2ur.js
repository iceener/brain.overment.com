It quickly became my sandbox for exploring what generative AI can and cannot do. Due to its complexity, it has been a significant programming challenge, as everything I design needs to work flawlessly (or at least aim to) while remaining flexible enough to keep up with the rapid pace of changes in the field.</p><p><img src="https://cloud.overment.com/SCR-20251004-kxud-1759572367.png" alt="Alice Application Preview"></p><h2 id="desktop-client-for-llms" tabindex="-1">Desktop Client for LLMs <a class="header-anchor" href="#desktop-client-for-llms" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Desktop Client for LLMs&quot;">​</a></h2><p><img src="https://cloud.overment.com/SCR-20251004-kxne-1759572322.png" alt=""></p><p>Alice is an advanced chat UI for LLMs with a minimalistic interface. It provides easy access to large language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, xAI, and open-source models using Groq, Ollama, or LMStudio. It also supports integration with MCP (Model Context Protocol), offering Tools, Prompts, Resources, and Sampling.</p><p>The Alice app is a highly customizable blank slate that you can shape however you like, either by importing assistants from the library or by creating your own.</p><p>The key concepts of Alice are:</p><ul><li><strong>Assistants:</strong> Profiles with a name, avatar, and main system prompt that define their behavior.</li><li><strong>Skills:</strong> These are described through prompts, can be assigned to an assistant, and invoked during conversations via the <code>/</code> button or the available menu.</li><li><strong>Tools:</strong> Tools can be added using Model Context Protocol servers, allowing assistants to access and use external apps or services.</li><li><strong>Documents:</strong> You can upload text-based documents and assign them to assistants so they can explore them during chats using AI agentic logic.</li><li><strong>Memories</strong>: Enable memory for assistants to store and retrieve information. Create memories manually or ask assistants to memorize things during conversations. Stored memories become available in future chats and tool use.</li></ul><p><a href="https://heyalice.app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Start 21-days trial</a></p><h2 id="personal-ai-agent" tabindex="-1">Personal AI agent <a class="header-anchor" href="#personal-ai-agent" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Personal AI agent&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Alice has her own personality, appearance, voice, memory, and skills. She can access the Internet as well as external apps and services. Technically, she is a back-end application running on my VPS and can be accessed directly through my watch, phone, or car.

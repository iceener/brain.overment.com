The problem is that ONLY &#39;deep work&#39; allows us to operate at the limits of our abilities and generate usually unattainable results.</p><p>Deep Work is an ability to work on a single task for a specified period of time with <strong>active focus</strong> and without any distractions.</p><p>It is based on principles:</p><ul><li>Effort,</li><li>Boredom,</li><li>No Social Media and designating time for shallow work (e.g., answering emails).</li></ul><p>It is a skill like any other, which needs to be trained to perform better over time.

one of the most powerful concepts i know. using it properly leads me to a place where i can do something now and getting results for the next couple of years or even  for a rest of my life. i have a couple of rules of using this concept my time is not for sale  since q2 2020 i have made a decision not to sell my time. i have almost completely reduced consulting and work for clients in favor of developing my own products. i only do this when it either makes me happy or gives me benefits way beyond financial. i take actions that take advantage of scale and help others for a long time like creating online content when i tak action i ask myself how to make 100 hour of a single hour i pay attention to small details. i eliminate them with automation..toolsautomation.md or optimize them e.g. by simplifying to the reasonable limits i automate many areas of my daily work. i have an army of robots that work for me day and night. the most interesting and important form of leverage is the

decision making process. my processprocess.md and a direction are coming directly from them.each of the following values are equallty important to me and unchanging throughout my life. my lifes philosophyto inspire others to grow. my values quriosity thats a source of everything i love. freedom which comes from discipline. enthusiasm this attitude helps me overcome everything.you may wonder how do i use those values in a daily life. well wheter i make an important decision i going back to my values asking is this decision in line with them and leading me in the direction i have set. if so i wont think twice.values not only helps with though decisions but also makes a decisionmaking process most efficient. i may say that everytime i make a decision with my values i end up with a good result. however our perception of reality must still be taken into account and in particular the words of ray dalio who said that we are not able to see a reality as it is because of our ego and blind spots.  how did i define my valuesthere was a program reign and ownhttpszenjaskiniowca.plprogramypanujiposiadaj pl from rafa mazur in which ive found a process guiding me through defining my lifes philosophy and mission.i wont describe the entire process here due to the fact that it is a part of the rafas program. i can only recommend its purchase and follow all the stepps according to his suggestions.  are my values changing in my case enthusiasm has been added to the list recently. the reason for this was a moment of realization that took place when i read the book almanack of naval ravikant..booksalmanack20of20naval20ravikant.md. one of the quotes of navals said that feeling happy is a matter of our decision. i believe an enthusiasm is a very important part of this. from that point on i decided to take it serously contraty to what the big five test told me suggesting that in terms of enthusiasm im in the 1st percentile lowest. at the same time books such as the happines advantage..booksthe20happines20advantage.md and letting go..booksletting20go.md suggests unequivocally the huge role of enthusiasm in achieving

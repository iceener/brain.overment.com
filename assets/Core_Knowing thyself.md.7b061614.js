Know Thyself)</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>A short context before we start:</strong> \u26A0\uFE0F Personality tests are tools. They don&#39;t define anything, they just point out useful parts. Their greatest advantage is that they encourage self-reflection and comparison of their results with reality. Performing the test does not give much. I only became effective after exploring the enclosed materials and reading books about them.</p><h2 id="mbti" tabindex="-1">MBTI <a class="header-anchor" href="#mbti" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>MBTI also known as 16Personalities test (althrough according to some sources MBTI is not exactly 16Personalities).

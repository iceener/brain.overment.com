If a response in the format <code>{&quot;data&quot;: &quot;...response&quot;}</code> is returned from the integration, its content will be added to the conversation and can be used in further dialogue.</li></ul><p><a href="https://heyalice.app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Buy lifetime version of Alice</a></p><h2 id="private-version" tabindex="-1">Private version <a class="header-anchor" href="#private-version" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Private version of <code>Alice</code> is a server application (API) with advanced logic based on large language models.

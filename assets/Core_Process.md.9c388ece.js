To make it better each day and what&#39;s more important, to make it effective, I&#39;m constantly questioning, modyfing and improving it. It probably <strong>will not work for you</strong>, but you will certainly find plenty of inspiration and resources, which may help you build your own.</p><blockquote><p><em>Everyone is constantly telling you what is good for you.

And btw. this is how I use a concept <a href="./../Mental Models/Genius of the AND.html">Genius of the AND</a> from Jim Collins.</p><p>In a practice, I find it difficult to determine the future for more than a week ahead (sometimes even this is impossible). It&#39;s not uncommon for me to have no idea what I&#39;ll be doing the next day. At the same time, I have a general outline of where I am going.</p><h2 id="my-attitude-toward-goals" tabindex="-1">My attitude toward Goals <a class="header-anchor" href="#my-attitude-toward-goals" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>A well-defined goal, <strong>determines the end result</strong> and a deadline (<a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SMART</a>.) . Combined with the visualization of a realized goal, we form the right attitudes (e.g.: enthusiasm, one of my <a href="./Values.html">Values</a>).</p><p>For a bigger goals, it is a good idea to divide them into a smaller chunks, to reduce &quot;Resistance&quot; about you can learn more in the <a href="./../Books/War of Art.html">War of Art</a> book. The realization of smaller goals imparts momentum through, among other things, the use of dopamine, about which more you can learn from <a href="./../Learning/Huberman Lab.html">Huberman Lab</a>.</p><p><strong>In practice, goals have a few important drawbacks:</strong></p><ul><li>goals build expectations which may not match reality or an actual result</li><li>we never know IF we really want it (that&#39;s one is hard to believe)</li><li>we never know what we are really going to get and what price we need to pay</li><li>achieving a big goal has an effect of &quot;<strong>well, but now what?!</strong>&quot;</li><li>giving up the target and modyfing it is not easy (i.e. because of a <a href="./../Mental Models/Commitment Bias.html">Commitment Bias</a> and/or <a href="./../Mental Models/Status Quo Bias.html">Status Quo Bias</a>)</li></ul><p>Among other reasons I use goals on a case-by-case basis. Previously I used an OKR system, but I found it stupid because this system was developed for an organization like Google or Intel, not individuals (that&#39;s my opinion). Today I mainly operate on the basis of the <a href="./Process.html">Process</a> and the <a href="./Direction.html">Direction</a>.</p><h2 id="direction-vs-goal" tabindex="-1">Direction vs. Goal <a class="header-anchor" href="#direction-vs-goal" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><ul><li>A goal has a deadline and conditions for its fulfillment.

I manage to keep a good condition with activities like:</p><ul><li><strong>Regular Sleep</strong> \u2014 you can learn more about this from <a href="./../Learning/Huberman Lab.html">Huberman Lab</a> podcast. I sleep at least 7 hours and do not use additional aids beside of Ashwagandha. I avoid screens at least an hour before bedtime.</li><li><strong>Diet</strong> \u2014 Vitamin D, K, Omega 3 and Magnesium. Once every quarter I eat bee pollen diluted overnight in boiled, cooled water (\u26A0\uFE0F NOTE: bee pollen is a strong allergen).</li><li><strong>Sport</strong> \u2014 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">3x a week</a> and Romwod (see more at <a href="./../Tools/Apps.html">Apps</a>).</li><li><strong>Breathing exercises with apps</strong> \u2014 <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oak-meditation-breathing/id1210209691" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Oak</a>, <a href="https://headspace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Headspace</a> and <a href="https://www.reveri.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Reveri</a> (see more at <a href="./../Tools/Apps.html">Apps</a>).</li><li><strong>Doing nothing</strong> \u2014 that&#39;s a form of a meditation but without any rules. I just do nothing for ~45 minutes a day. This is a key activity to me for remaining creative and calm.</li><li><strong>Focusing on what I&#39;m doing</strong> \u2014 I listen to <a href="https://endel.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">endel.io</a> (see more at <a href="./../Tools/Apps.html">Apps</a>).</li></ul><p>Developing my Process couldn&#39;t be possible without a deep understanding of myself. This is the most important part of a process itself. I mean by this i.e.:</p><ul><li><strong>Keeping a Jorunal</strong></li><li><strong>Personality Tests</strong> (MBTI, StrenghtsFinder, Principles You and The Big Five)</li><li><strong>Spending time in a soltitude</strong>, mostly offline</li><li><strong>Staying open</strong> which includes making mistakes. Books like <a href="./../Books/Think Like a Rocket Scientist.html">Think Like a Rocket Scientist</a> and <a href="./../Books/Black Box Thinking.html">Black Box Thinking</a> have taught me about this a lot.</li></ul><p>While creating my Process and improving it isn&#39;t an easy task, actually living by all of those rules is even harder. But there is one thing, which makes it possible and that is \u2014 my surrounding. I believe that it is impossible to fundamentally change ourselves, but our beliefs and habits may change.</p><ul><li><strong>Nearest Surrounding</strong> \u2014 I pay attention to with whom I spend the most time</li><li><strong>Proactivity</strong> \u2014 I actively take care of my relationship with people who are important to me</li><li><strong>Discovery</strong> \u2014 I intentionally reach out people I feel I want to have contact with. The same goes with activities I feel like are good to me.</li><li><strong>Limitation</strong> \u2014 I avoid meeting and being among people who take my energy (or I take away theirs). Constraints are also a very important part of my Creative and Decision Making processes.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Surround yourself with people who have achieved what you want to achieve and have something in common with them.</p></blockquote><p>Beside of my Process, I had develop my unique style of work. An answer to a fraquent question I receive &quot;How are you able to manage all of this&quot; is this:</p><ul><li><strong>Actual work</strong> \u2014 I work everyday ~8-12 hours a day, 6 or 7 days a week</li><li><strong>Focus &amp; Relax</strong> \u2014 I maintain as much both focus and high quality rest as possible</li><li><strong>Leverage</strong> \u2014 I use <a href="./../Tools/Automation.html">Automation</a>, <a href="./../Tools/Hardware.html">Hardware</a> and <a href="./../Tools/Apps.html">Apps</a> which saves me a lot of time and energy</li></ul><p>In other words, I do everything to make the best use of my time and energy. For this is necessary to build an efficient <a href="./Process.html">Process</a> and a core foundations of it. Probably one of the most important puzzles of all of this is to learn how to rest effectively. One day I&#39;ve receieved a suggestion \u2014 &quot;Adam, if you work hard, you must also rest in a same way&quot;. I completly agree with this.</p><p>Up until now, a couple of times I&#39;ve mentioned a <a href="./../Mental Models/Leverage.html">Leverage</a>. This is one of the most powerful concepts I know. Using it properly leads me to a place where I can do something now, and getting results for the next couple of years or even \u2014 for a rest of my life. I have a couple of rules of using this concept:</p><ul><li><strong>My time is not for sale</strong> \u2014 since Q2 2020 I have made a decision not to sell my time. I have almost completely reduced consulting and work for clients in favor of developing my own products. I only do this when it either makes me happy or gives me benefits way beyond financial.</li><li>I take actions that take advantage of scale and help others for a long time (like creating online content)</li><li>When I tak action I ask myself &quot;<em>How to make 100 hour of a single hour?</em>&quot;</li><li>I pay attention to small details. I eliminate them with <a href="./../Tools/Automation.html">Automation</a> or optimize them (e.g., by simplifying) to the reasonable limits</li><li>I automate many areas of my daily work. I have an army of robots, that work for me day and night.</li></ul><blockquote><p><em>The most interesting and important form of leverage is the idea of a product with minimal replication cost. ~ Naval Ravikant</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>Additional sources:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.kapilguptamd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Kapil Gupta</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwQhKFMxmDY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Huberman &amp; Rich Roll</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivLcmB_Gogc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Marek Kaczmarzyk @ TEDx</a> (PL) \u2014 &quot;If so much information reaches our brain every second, how are the most relevant ones selected?
